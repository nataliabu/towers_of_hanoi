## About me

I am a puzzle who has three stacks and many disks.

I start with all my disks on the left stack and the objective of the game is to bring the whole the stack of disks to the rightmost stack.

## My rules

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.


## What do you need?

* Python 3
* The [node](https://github.com/nataliabu/linear_data_structures/blob/main/node.py) and [stack](https://github.com/nataliabu/linear_data_structures/blob/main/stack.py) modules from my [linear data structures library](https://github.com/nataliabu/linear_data_structures)

## How to run me
